# FRC Game 2020

This repository contains the code for the FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) game of the year 2020, "INFINITE RECHARGE." 

## About FRC
FRC is an international high school robotics competition organized by FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). Each year, teams of students, guided by mentors, design, build, and program robots to compete in a unique game challenge.

The competition aims to inspire young people to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields by providing them with hands-on experience in a real-world engineering environment.

## Game Overview: INFINITE RECHARGE
INFINITE RECHARGE is a space-themed game that takes place in a future where the Earth's energy supply is running critically low. In this game, alliances of three teams work together to gather and process power cells to energize a simulated Shield Generator.

The main objectives of the game include:
- Shooting power cells into goals to score points
- Manipulating control panels to activate specific game elements
- Climbing the generator switch at the end of the match to earn additional points

To succeed in the game, teams need to strategize, collaborate, and build robots that can perform a range of tasks efficiently. Mechanical, electrical, and programming skills are crucial in developing a competitive robot.
